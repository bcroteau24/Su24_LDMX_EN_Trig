# Su24_LDMX_EN_Trig
Repository for notebooks used to develop EN trigger summer 2024. 
Includes code for rate plots, comparisons, efficiency plots.
I am sorry to say--I never automated by plotting process, I did in fact write over the same plotting code every time I went to make a plot. As such, specific plotting settings used for specific plots are not saved.
Efficiency plotting code in EN_efficiency_plotting.
einclusive_plotting1 has plotting code for rate plots.
